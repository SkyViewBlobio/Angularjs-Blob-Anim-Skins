# Private-Repository!
- a private repository to not have other io-companies steal our animated skins.

Here i pushed all of the compatible skins that will work with each other and do not need any further fixing. The rest of the skins have Compatibility issues with each other (Luckily those that have those issues are rather basic / ugly.

I have implemented the most beautiful & most upvoted Shaders ready to be used as Skins. 

# Order & Coordination
- i have used a numeric system which is basic since you guys (Mikhail / Valdex / Foris) will probably change the name at the final implementation so i didn't bother adding names like ("fire_shader").
- Each shader has its main class where size / repeater / growth & and many other customiseable options are handled to customise them further if you like to! ive added helpful comments that show you what each value changes.
- Each Shader uses a canvas and a ccs class but they're not interesting for you since you guys won't need them in order for the shader to work. 
- All you need to implement the shaders are their main classes.

# Video of numeric order
- here is a video of the numeric order it will show you which shader is who:
